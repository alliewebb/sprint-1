The command line is a way of talking to your computer and telling it to do things without using apps or the graphics which allow you to visualise what's happening. Instead of clicking on folders and navigating that way, you are typing in specific commands which do the same thing. 

10 Commands and what they do:
1. pwd means Print Working Directory. This shows you where you are on the computer by giving you a location.
2. mkdir means Make Directory. This allows you to create a new directory (folder) within the directory you are currently in.
3. cd means Change Directory. This allows you to move into another directory within the directory you are in. After the cd command you type the name of the directory you would like to change to.
4. cd .. is the same as the above but allows you to move back to the parent directory of the directory you are in.
5. cd ~ will change your directory to the home directory.
6. rmdir means Remove Directory. This allows you to delete a directory as long as the directory is empty.
7. mv means Move. This allows you to move or rename a file or directory.
8. touch creates an empty file.
9. rm means Remove and will delete a file.
10. cp menas Copy and will copy the specified file or directory.
